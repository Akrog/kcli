- products and repo support to leverage plans and make them easier to use
- added clean parameter to kcli product to remove downloaded plan
- helm and fission plan
- allow minimal syntax in config.yml to specify default values but implicitly using the local hypervisor
- support for repo and products in the web version
- allow to specify a plan name when deploying a product
- full KMETA list from my github repo
- merged copr and packagecloud plans ( only useful for me, as this is what i use to build rpm and deb)
