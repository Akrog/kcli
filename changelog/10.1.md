- rendering of parameters using jinja2 and --set ( or --paramfile ) in profile, plan and product. This is used also in scripts and commands. To make it easy to use, an additional *parameters* keyword can be added in the plan to define parameters ( and to easily set default values )
- Auto rendering of the name parameter so one can easily change the name when using a single vm in a plan/product
- Rewriting of most of the provided plans to make use of the rendering functionality
- Transfer parameters from a father plan to its chidren when using a "plan of plans"
- use *base* keyword in profiles to indicate a base profile ( and defaults to its values when not found). Note that commands and scripts are rather concatenated
- possibility to indicate a list of hypervisors in most commands (kcli -C host1,host2)
- select a random hypervisor when using `kcli -C host1,host2,... vm`
- bitbar extra to list vms from your menu bar
- allow filtering of products per group
- information on product, in particular available dynamic parameters
- indicate memory used by a product
- enable (optional) injection of the private key of the user too with the privatekey keyword)
- filtering of values to return in kcli info
- allow use of the mode keyword in the files section ( old keyword permission can still be used )
- allow X11 forwarding in kcli ssh
- additional openshift plans with multiple vms
- old openshift releases plans
- istio plan improvements
- report yaml exception when config file cant be parsed
- ansible logs in openshift multimaster plan
- minishift per version
- boot from iso when cloudinit is enabled and iso present
- ovirt42 plan
- remove wget from ovirt plans in favor of files section
- katello preliminary plan
- workaround for ansible service broker issues plan
- silent download
- properly expand scripts when not running plan from current directory
- better dynamic support in web
- fedora 27 cloud image
- delete generated pub and private keyfiles along with plan

Note: as of this version, most of the karmab repository have been rewritten to use rendering
This means that if you don't use a version of kcli >10.X but still points at this same repository, you won'get proper results ( as the dynamic variables will betreated as static). Either update (recommended) or use the following alternative repository 

```
kcli repo -u github.com/karmab/kcli/plans_legacy karmab_legacy
```
