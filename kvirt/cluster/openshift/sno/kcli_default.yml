    Deploys an openshift SNO ISO using openshift-install, particularly suited at Baremetal
    With sno_wait, we wait for installation to finish
    This typically requires to be able to reach the cluster API through DNS
    a VIP can be added to the ISO to ease connection.
    The baremetal_hosts array can be used to use redfish to start the node using an iso
    This assumes a web server such as apache/nging to be running where this process is launched from.
    baremetal options exist to only copy the ISO to a given place (useful if you run the web server using a container by yourself)
